# WordCloud
In this Code, libraries like nltk, matplotlib, wordcloud, numpy and pandas are used 
A user's choice of data is given as input and all the stop words are removed example: was, won't, were etc
Then using wordcloud library the PNG image is generated using only those words in the color of YlGnBu shades and is stored to desired location
After that the same words are now placed inside a shape which is imported and then displayed
